### 5. Even or Odd Checker
- **Description**: Determines whether a number is even or odd.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses modulus operator to check divisibility by 2.
  - Outputs either "The number is even" or "The number is odd."

---

### 6. Triangle Validity Checker
- **Description**: Checks if three given sides can form a valid triangle.
- **Key Features**:
  - Validates input to ensure positive values.

### 8. Gross Salary Calculator
- **Description**: Calculates the gross salary of an employee based on their basic salary.
- **Key Features**:
  - Applies different percentages for HRA and DA based on salary range:
    - Basic salary ≤ 10,000: HRA = 20%, DA = 80%.
    - Basic salary ≤ 20,000: HRA = 25%, DA = 90%.
    - Basic salary > 20,000: HRA = 30%, DA = 95%.
  - Outputs the gross salary.
