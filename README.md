# Java Programs

## 1. Program to Enter the Access Code and Check Whether the Door is Open or Not (`AccessCode.java`)

This Java program checks if a user-entered access code matches a predefined code (`1234`) to determine whether the door is open or closed.

### Code Details:
1. **Scanner Class**: Used to take user input from the console.
2. **Access Code**: The program prompts the user to enter a numeric code.
3. **Logic**:
   - If the entered code equals `1234`, the program prints "Door is open."
   - Otherwise, it prints "Door is closed."
4. **File Name**: 
   - The file must be saved as `AccessCode.java` since the class name in the program is `AccessCode`.

## 2. Program to Check Voting Eligibility (`VotingEligibility.java`)

This Java program determines whether a user is eligible to vote based on their age.

### Code Details:
1. **Scanner Class**: Used to read user input from the console.
2. **Input**: The program asks the user to enter their age.
3. **Logic**:
   - If the age is **18 or more**, the program prints "You are eligible to vote."
   - If the age is **less than 18**, it prints "You are not eligible to vote."
4. **File Name**: 
   - The file must be saved as `VotingEligibility.java` since the class name in the program is `VotingEligibility`.

### Summary

These Java programs demonstrate basic input handling and conditional logic:
- **AccessCode.java**: Verifies a predefined access code to open or close the door.
- **VotingEligibility.java**: Checks if the user's age meets the minimum requirement for voting.
