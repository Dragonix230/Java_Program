# Java Program

## 1. Program to Enter the Access Code and Check Whether the Door is Open or Not (`AccessCode.java`)

This Java program checks if a user-entered access code matches a predefined code (`1234`) to determine whether the door is open or closed.

### Code Details:
1. **Scanner Class**: Used to take user input from the console.
2. **Access Code**: The user is prompted to enter a numeric code.
3. **Condition**:
   - If the entered code equals `1234`, the program prints "Door is open."
   - Otherwise, it prints "Door is closed."
4. **File Name**: 
   - The file must be saved as `AccessCode.java` since the class name in the program is `AccessCode`.
