# Java Program

## 1. Program to Enter the Access Code and Check Whether the Door is Open or Not (`AccessCode.java`)

This Java program checks if a user-entered access code matches a predefined code (`1234`) to determine whether the door is open or closed.

### Code Details:
1. **Scanner Class**: Used to take user input from the console.
2. **Access Code**: The user is prompted to enter a numeric code.
3. **Condition**:
   - If the entered code equals `1234`, the program prints "Door is open."
   - Otherwise, it prints "Door is closed."
4. **File Name**: 
   - The file must be saved as `AccessCode.java` since the class name in the program is `AccessCode`.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Scanner Class**: Used to read the user input (age).
2. **Input**: The program asks the user to enter their age.
3. **Condition**: 
   - If the age is **18 or more**, the program prints "You are eligible to vote."
   - If the age is **less than 18**, it prints "You are not eligible to vote."
4. **Class Name**: `VotingEligibility` — so the file name should be `VotingEligibility.java`.

### Short Summary:
The program checks if the user’s age is 18 or greater to determine voting eligibility.
