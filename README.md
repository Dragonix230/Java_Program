### 1. **Access Code Verification (`AccessCode.java`)**
   - **Purpose**: To check if the user-entered code matches a predefined code (`1234`) to open or close the door.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Uses `Scanner` for user input.
     - Compares the input with the predefined code.
     - Outputs "Door is open" or "Door is closed."
   - **File Name**: `AccessCode.java`

### 2. **Voting Eligibility Checker (`VotingEligibility.java`)**
   - **Purpose**: To determine if the user is eligible to vote based on age.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Prompts the user to input their age.
     - Checks if the age is 18 or above.
     - Outputs voting eligibility status.
   - **File Name**: `VotingEligibility.java`

### 3. **Number Classification (`NumberCheck.java`)**
   - **Purpose**: To classify a number as positive, negative, or zero with input validation.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Ensures the input is a valid integer.
     - Identifies the number as positive, negative, or zero.
     - Handles invalid input with an error message.
   - **File Name**: `NumberCheck.java`

### 4. **Grade Assignment (`GradeChecker.java`)**
   - **Purpose**: To assign a grade based on marks entered by the user.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Validates marks to ensure they are between 0 and 100.
     - Assigns grades (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, or `F`) based on score ranges.
     - Displays an error message for invalid marks.
   - **File Name**: `GradeChecker.java`

---

### 5. **Even or Odd Checker (`EvenOddChecker.java`)**
   - **Purpose**: To determine whether a number is even or odd.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Uses the modulus operator (`%`) to check divisibility by 2.
     - Outputs "The number is even" or "The number is odd."
   - **File Name**: `EvenOddChecker.java`

---

### Summary
These programs cover a variety of foundational programming skills, including:
- Input handling with `Scanner`.
- Conditional logic (`if-else` statements).
- Input validation and error handling.
- Use of mathematical operations and basic data processing.
