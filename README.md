### 1. Access Code Verification
- **Description**: This program checks if a user-entered access code matches the predefined code to determine if the door opens or remains closed.  

---

### 2–20 ... (Details for these programs are as provided earlier)

---

### 21. Numbers from 1 to N
- **Description**: Prints numbers from 1 to N, where N is provided by the user.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Takes user input for the value of `N`.  
  - Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `N`.  
  - Outputs the sequence of numbers.

---

### 22. Number Printing with Nested For Loop
- **Description**: Prints a sequence of numbers using nested `for` loops.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Demonstrates how nested loops can be used for multiple iterations.  
  - Outputs structured sequences.

---

### 23. Pattern Printing with Nested For Loop
- **Description**: Prints a pattern of “@” symbols using nested `for` loops.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Uses nested `for` loops to control rows and columns.  
  - Outputs a pattern in the form of a triangle or square.

---

### 24. Factorial Calculator
- **Description**: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Takes user input for the number.  
  - Uses a loop to calculate the factorial.  
  - Outputs the result.

---

### 25. Sum of N Numbers
- **Description**: Calculates the sum of the first N numbers, where N is entered by the user.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Takes user input for the value of `N`.  
  - Uses a loop to sum all integers from 1 to `N`.  
  - Outputs the total sum.
